Controls are the final cog in the UI machinery of mario kart wii. They are contained in Pages (page.hpp) and are the actual UI describing classes.
A control has two independant parts:
-> Its graphical appearance. This is purely handled via external files:
-BRCTR files describe the position and the text contained by a control, which BRLYT file to use and which BRLAN file to use
-BRLYT files describe the position of the sub-elements of the controls (for example the course select button is the cupicon image but also the border), which images (TPL files) to use,
which animations are tied to which elements. They do so by describing materials (images and textures) contained within Panes. A pane (nw4r::lyt::Pane) describes one sub element of the control.
For example, the course select button's cup icon is a picture pane. It contains a material but also is linked to an animation group.
-BRLAN files describe animations. These very basic files (relative to brlyts) are used to create various animations (out of 6 types)
which can be about color, visibility, texture, scane, rotation, translation etc...

Because a control's graphical appearance is completely determined by these files, the same class can be used for controls that look completely different but have the same functionality. This is how buttons are made to look different

-> Its functionality. This is completely determined by the class own functions. This can be just a purely graphical element (LayoutUIControl, no interaction possible with it), or an interactable one
(PushButton, RadioButton etc...)

->UIControl is the base class of every control in the game. However, it is purely functional and nothing can be drawn with just a UIControl.
Indeed, the class instance needs to have the graphical files the user wants to use loaded AND tied to it so that they can be drawn.

->To do so, LayoutUIControl is a child of UIControl that adds a MainLayout subclass
-MainLayout contains a resource accessor that points to all the raw files. It is built by specifying a brlyt file, creates the panes and is able to draw them
-LayoutUIControl also contains a UIAnimator, which can load animations and then, once the layout is specific to that animator, it can play any animation (since the layout gives access to the panes)
-However, in practice BRCTR files are the ones who specify which BRLYT and BRLAN to load. The game therefore provides a ControlLoader class:
It comes with a Load function where the brctr is specified (folder, name) and which animations the user wants to use (the brctr may contain different animation groups, ie a bunch of BRLANs, all optional)
That function fetches the BRCTR, BRLYT (specified by the BRCTR) and BRLANs (specified by the BRCTR) from the szs archive (MenuSingle, Race etc...), builds the MainLayout and the UIAnimator,
grabs the relevant information from the files, copies it into the classes.

->Therefore, creating a LayoutUIControl and then using ControlLoader::Load will make the control appear

->If the control is supposed to do something other than be drawn, then it should do so via functions.

->Controls are contained in Pages. They are grouped together in ControlGroup, and will only appear if they were added to a Page's group (via Page::AddControl, a simple wrapper around ControlGroup::SetControl)

->But ControlGroup also allows controls to contain subcontrols. It is in practice seldom used in the game, and may seem useless since the page already contains all controls.
However, it has one important use, which is that if a control is added to another as a subcontrol (part of the "parent"'s ControlGroup), then moving the parent will move the subcontrol too.
That way, arrays of controls can easily be created, and this is most notably used on the KartSelect page, which uses 2 columns of buttons, but is also used elsewhere.

->Animations are described by BRLAN files but they live in between the two parts, as a given animation can be forced via functions.

INTERACTING WITH CONTROLS:
->It is desirably to be able to interact with controls. It is relatively intuitive to think that adding a function that checks for the A press should load the next page.
But that poses a core problem, which is that a control only describes itself; it has no idea of the existence and position of other controls.
Thefore that control does not know that the player is currently selecting it. Moreover, if instead of A, left is pressed, how would a control know what is the control to its left?

->The game solves that issue by using ManipulatorManagers, contained in Pages, see manipulator.hpp

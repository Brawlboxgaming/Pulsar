-If no controller input is made on the strap screen, boot to wiimmfi will be skipped (as it stands, no way to determine which controller the player is attempting to use)

-Improved sample inheritance file for those wanting to write their own codes
-Settings can now be accessed on packs that have neither feathers nor 200cc.
-Fixed BMG issue on GPs
